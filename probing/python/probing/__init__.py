"""
Probing - Dynamic Performance Profiler for Distributed AI

Spec
----
This is the top-level package for the Probing library. It serves as the main entry point
for users and integrations.

Responsibilities:
1.  Export core primitives for operating probing, including `query` and `load_extension`.
2.  Export control functions (enable/disable tracer, CLI main) for runtime management.
3.  Export high-level APIs for tracing (span, event) and engine queries.
4.  Initialize configuration and environment settings.

Public Interfaces:
- Engine: `query`, `load_extension`
- Control: `cli_main`, `enable_tracer`, `disable_tracer`, `is_enabled`
- Tracing: `span`, `event`, `record_span`, `step`
- Engine: `query`, `load_extension`

Pulsing integration is passive: when another runtime writes ``pulsing.*`` memtables
under the shared data directory, probing exposes them as SQL tables. Probing does not
discover, bootstrap, or sync Pulsing cluster membership.
